# ðŸ“† Simple MUI Calendar

After searching and not finding any interesting calendar library, I decided to create one from scratch using MUI (Material-UI).

This project serves as an example of a calendar with just the basics. 
You can use it as a reference to create your own calendar and style it according to your preferences.
